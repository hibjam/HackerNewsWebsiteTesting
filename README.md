# HackerNewsWebsiteTesting
This is a project that was created in order to begin testing practice with Selenium and also Cucumber. 

It showcases my use of Selenium to test the HackerNews website and implements a Behaviour Driver Development framework on top of this in order to test the framework.

Please note that this project is still in development, and as such many of the classes will not contain methods, however I beleive it demonstrates a concrete fundamental understanding of Selenium and Cucumber. 
The classes containing with the most code are the HNLoginPage, the HNPastPage, the HNHomePage and the HNWebPage.

If you would lie to view a complete project which covers the fundamentals of Java. Please see my [Sort Manager Project](https://github.com/hibjam/SortManager).
